**LiteApp is a high performance mobile cross-platform framework. The implementation of its cross-platform functionality is based on webview but improved with novel ideas and solutions for better performance.**

`LiteApp` dedicates to enable developers to use modern web development technology to build applications on both Android and iOS with a single codebase. More specifically, you can use javascript and modern front-end framework Vue.js to develop mobile apps by using LiteApp, with which, productivity and performance can coexist ,application you build will be running on web with performance close to native. We achieve this by decoupling the render engine from the syntax layer, see more detail below.
